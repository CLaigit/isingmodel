1. 4 picture for 2d ising model
    (each picture with 3-4 different lattice length ~5 ~ 20 ~200 ~1000)
    (warm up process can be shorter, like 10^3 should be enough I guess)
    (but you can test it first)
    (calculate the steepest position and get the critical temperature)
2. 4 picture for 3d ising model
3. video
4. CUDA code(add heat capacity, magnetization, magnetization susceptibility)
    (time the code, compare it with c code)
    (In Chen's cuda code, the one can work is with the commit "naive cuda code")
    (can be a reference for cuda kernal rand() function)
5. I will try to fit the data tomorrow.
